Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

Runtime Polymorphism in Java:
is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather 
than compile-time.

Method Overriding in Java:
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as 
method overriding in Java.


Method Overloading in Java:
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, 
it is known as Method Overloading.
